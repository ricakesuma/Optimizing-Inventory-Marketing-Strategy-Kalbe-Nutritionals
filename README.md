# Optimizing-Inventory-Marketing-Strategy-Kalbe-Nutritionals

### Introduction : **Optimizing Inventory & Marketing Strategy: The Kalbe Data Science Challenge**

At Kalbe Nutritionals, a new initiative is underway, spearheaded by the Data Science team in collaboration with the Inventory and Marketing departments. The project's aim is twofold: to enhance inventory management through accurate daily sales predictions and to refine marketing strategies via customer segmentation.

The focus on sales forecasting is driven by the need for efficient inventory management. By predicting daily product sales, the Inventory team can better manage stock levels, ensuring availability while minimizing excess. This approach is critical for operational efficiency and cost reduction.

Simultaneously, the Marketing team's objective is to develop a nuanced understanding of the customer base through segmentation. This analysis will enable personalized marketing efforts, leading to more effective promotions and improved customer engagement. The synergy of these two objectives is expected to bolster Kalbe's operational excellence and market presence, demonstrating the transformative impact of data-driven decision-making in the competitive health foods and nutrition industry.

## Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Data Loading and Preliminary Checks**:
   - Essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn were imported to facilitate data handling and visualization.
   - The datasets for customers, products, stores, and transactions were loaded, setting the stage for a comprehensive analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Initial preprocessing steps were undertaken to ensure data quality. This likely included handling missing values and removing duplicates, which are crucial steps to maintain the integrity of the analysis.

3. **Data Aggregation and Summarization**:
   - The analysis involved aggregating data, possibly summing up quantities or other metrics. This step is essential for understanding larger trends and patterns within the dataset.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visual representations of the data were created using matplotlib. This step is vital for uncovering insights that might not be immediately apparent in raw data, such as trends, outliers, or patterns.

5. **Clustering and Customer Segmentation**:
